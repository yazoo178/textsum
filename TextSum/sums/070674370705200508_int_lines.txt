Brief CommunicationThe Montreal Cognitive Assessment:Validity and Utility in a Memory Clinic SettingTasha Smith, BM, MSc, MRCPsych1, Nadia Gildeh, BM2,Clive Holmes, MB, ChB, MRCPsych, PhD3Objective: To prospectively validate the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in a UKmemory clinic.Method: We administered the MoCA and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to 32subjects fulfilling diagnostic criteria for dementia, to 23 subjects fulfilling diagnosticcriteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and to 12 memory clinic comparisonsubjects, at baseline and then at 6-month follow-up.	:0
Clinical diagnoses for dementia andMCI were made according to ICD-10 and Petersen criteria.	:1
The sensitivity and specificityof both measures were assessed for detection of MCI and dementia.Results: With a cut-off score of 26, the MMSE had a sensitivity of 17% to detect subjectswith MCI, whereas the MoCA detected 83%.	:2
The MMSE had a sensitivity of 25% todetect subjects with dementia, whereas the MoCA detected 94%.	:3
Specificity for the MMSEwas 100%, and specificity for the MoCA was 50%.	:4
Of subjects with MCI, 35% developeddementia within 6 months, and all scored less than 26 points on the MoCA at baseline.Conclusions: The MoCA is a useful brief screening tool for the detection of mild dementiaor MCI in subjects scoring over 25 points on the MMSE.	:5
In patients already diagnosedwith MCI, the MoCA helps identify those at risk of developing dementia at 6-monthfollow-up.	:6

Subjects with MCI represent an at-riskgroup for the development of dementia, with around 10% to40% of subjects developing dementia within 1 year.1–5The MMSE is a widely used screening tool for the identifica-tion of dementia, with a diagnostic threshold usually set at lessthan 25 points.6 However, the MMSE has very poor sensitiv-ity for individuals with MCI, with about 80% of the latterscoring above 26 points on the MMSE.7–10 Several studieshave shown that a large proportion of patients with dementia,including those in the early stages of AD, those with a highpremorbid IQ score, and those with non-AD dementia(including Lewy body dementia or frontotemporal lobedementia) often score above recognized cut-off points on theMMSE (that is, a score of more than 24 points).7–9 As a result,clinicians will often obtain more detailed neuropsychometrictesting if available or repeat the MMSE at a later date.The MoCA is a 10-minute, 30-point cognitive screening testdesigned to assist health professionals in the detection of MCIin patients scoring between 24 and 30 points on the MMSE.10The suggested cut-off point on the MoCA is 26.10 The MoCAhas more emphasis on tasks of frontal executive functioningand attention than the MMSE, which may make it more sensi-tive in detecting non-AD dementia.We sought to validate the MoCA in a UK memory clinic set-ting where subjects with a wide variety of illnesses may pres-ent with memory impairment.	:8
We also examined thediagnostic outcomes of all subjects at 6-month follow-up todetermine the usefulness of the MoCA as a predictive diag-nostic tool.MethodThis was a prospective study of patients attending a memoryclinic at the Memory Assessment Research Centre atMoorgreen Hospital, Southampton, between May 1, 2004,and June 30, 2005.	:9

Patients scoring above 24points on the MMSE were classified into 3 groups: dementia,MCI, or MCC.	:13
Dementia was defined according to ICD-10diagnostic criteria.11 MCI was defined according to the crite-ria of Petersen and colleagues,12 with objective evidence ofmemory loss determined by a clinician using theCAMCOG.13,14 The MCC was defined as those patients whohad a clearly identifiable psychiatric illness that explainedsubjective memory complaints or who had no objective evi-dence of memory loss (that is, those with a CAMCOG score> 89 points) at baseline or 6-month follow-up.	:14
Allsubjects were then seen 6 months later, at which time theMMSE and MoCA were repeated and a clinical diagnosis wasma d e f r o m t h e b a s e l i n e d i a g n o s t i c c r i t e r i a .	:16
T h eneuropsychological assessments were completed by trainedraters independent of, and blind to, the clinical diagnosis.Following methodology described elsewhere,10 we calculatedsensitivity as the percentage of subjects within a diagnosticcategory who scored less than 26 points on the MMSE orMoCA.	:17
We calculated specificity as the percentage of sub-jects in the MCC who scored at or above the cut-off score of26 points.	:18
Direct comparison of MoCA and MMSE scoreswas made with Pearson correlation, and analysis ofcovariance was used for between-groups comparison.ResultsWe identified 71 subjects who fulfilled the study inclusioncriteria.	:19
Of these subjects, 67 (94%) agreed to take part in thestudy.	:20
The mean age of the study group at baseline interviewwas 73.6 years, SD 10.0, with a mean illness duration of 1.8years, SD 1.9.	:21
The group had mean of 12.1 years of education,SD 2.5.	:22
Of the subjects, 33 (49.3%) were women.	:23
The meanMMSE score at baseline was 27.4 points, SD 1.6, with a rangeof 25 to 30 points; the mean MoCA score was 22.3 points, SD3.6, with a range of 14 to 29 points.At baseline, 32 subjects (48%) fulfilled ICD-10 diagnosticcriteria for dementia (18 with AD, 13 with vascular dementia,and 1 with Parkinson’s disease dementia), 23 subjects (34%)fulfilled diagnostic criteria for MCI, and 12 subjects (18%)fulfilled criteria for the MCC.	:24
Of the subjects defined as in theMCC, 4 fulfilled ICD-10 diagnostic criteria for psychiatric ill-ness (3 with depressive episode and 1 with generalized anxi-ety disorder), and 8 had no objective evidence of memory loss.Table 1 shows a significant difference in the distribution ofage across the diagnostic groups, with subjects in the MCCgroup being younger than subjects with MCI or dementia(F2,64 = 9.2, ç2 0.22, P < 0.001).	:25
There was a significant differ-ence in the distribution of MMSE scores by diagnostic group(F2,64 = 5.2, ç2 0.14, P = 0.008) that remained significant aftercorrecting for age (F2,63 = 3.8, ç2 0.10, P = 0.03).	:26
Similarly,there was a significant difference in the distribution of MoCAW La Revue canadienne de psychiatrie, vol 52, no 5, mai 2007The Montreal Cognitive Assessment: Validity and Utility in a Memory Clinic SettingTable 1 Demographic and cognitive outcomes by diagnostic groupDiagnosisMMSEMoCAAgeDurationEducationFemale sexn (%)Points (SD)Points (SD)Years (SD)Years (SD)Years (SD)n (%)Dementia32 (48)26.8 (1.5)21.0 (3.4)74.4 (9.3)1.7 (2.0)12.7 (2.5)12 (37)MCI23 (34)27.6 (1.6)22.5 (3.5)77.5 (7.8)2.2 (2.1)11.3 (2.5)13 (57)MCC12 (18)28.4 (1.5)25.0 (3.1)64.0 (10.8)1.3 (1.1)12.0 (2.5)8 (67)Table 2 Sensitivity and specificity of MMSE and MoCA by diagnostic group with a cut-off at 26 pointsTestMCISensitivity (95%CI)Specificity (95%CI)MMSEMoCAMMSEMoCA0.17 (0.08 to 0.34)0.83 (0.66 to 0.92)1.00 (0.82 to 1.00)0.50 (0.29 to 0.72)Dementia0.25 (0.15 to 0.39)0.94 (0.83 to 0.98)1.00 (0.82 to 1.00)0.50 (0.29 to 0.72)scores by diagnostic group (F2,64 = 6.1, ç2 0.16, P = 0.004) thatremained significant after correcting for age (F2,63 = 3.7,ç2 0.09, P = 0.03).	:27
The correlation between the MMSE andMoCA was modest (Pearson 0.62, P < 0.0001).Table 2 shows that the MoCA had high sensitivity in identify-ing MCI and dementia (83% and 94%, respectively).	:28
In con-trast, the sensitivity of the MMSE was poor (17% and 25%,respectively).	:29
The MMSE had excellent specificity, correctlyexcluding 100% of those subjects in the MCC group, whereasthe specificity of the MoCA was modest, at 50%.The mean follow-up interval for the total group was 6.0months, SD 1.3.	:30
For the MMSE, the mean rate of cognitivechange for the all subjects over this period was –1.0 points,SD 2.4 (for the dementia group, the mean rate was –0.8 points,SD 2.6; for the MCI group, it was –1.7 points, SD 2.3; and forthe MCC group, it was 0 points, SD 1.1).	:31
For the MoCA, themean rate of cognitive change for all subjects over this periodwas –0.7 points, SD 2.7 (for the dementia group, the mean ratewas –0.2 points, SD 2.7; for the MCI group, it was –1.7 points,SD 2.1; and for the MCC group, it was 0.2 points, SD 3.4).	:32
Similarly, no significant differenceswere found between the rates of decline when the MMSE andMoCA were compared overall or within diagnostic groups.The diagnosis of the 12 MCC subjects did not change frombaseline to 6-month follow-up.	:34
Of the 23 subjects diagnosedas having MCI at baseline, 8 (35%) were diagnosed as havingdementia (7 with AD and 1 with Parkinson’s disease demen-tia); 15 (65%) were still considered to have MCI at 6-monthfollow-up.	:35
Patients diagnosed as having dementia at 6-monthfollow-up had a lower MoCA score at baseline than those stilldesignated as MCI at follow-up (MoCA mean score 20.8points, SD 3.1, compared with mean 23.5 points, SD 3.3; P =0.03).	:36
A similar, but nonsignificant, trend also occurred forthe MMSE score at baseline (MMSE mean score 26.9 points,SD 1.5, compared with mean 27.9 points, SD 1.5; P = 0.07).The MoCA (using the established cut-off of 26 points) had100% sensitivity in identifying those MCI subjects at baselinediagnosed as having dementia at 6-month follow-up, whereasat 25%, the MMSE had poor sensitivity.DiscussionWe found sensitivity of the MMSE and the MoCA to detectMCI to be comparable to a previous study (17%, comparedwith 18%; and 83%, compared with 90%, respectively).10Similarly, we found the MoCA to have comparable sensitivityin detecting mild dementia (94%, compared with 100%).10Compared with another study,10 which reported a specificityof 87%, the specificity of the test in this study was just 50%.	:37
Thuslowered specificity in this study is likely to be a reflection ofthe heterogeneous nature of the MCC that may well includesubjects with subtle executive deficits that could be unde-tected by the CAMCOG but detected by the MoCA.Unfortunately, because only one clinician completed eachaspect of the diagnosis and the neuropsychometric testing andbecause clinicians were blind to the others’ findings, we wereunable to examine the interrater reliability of the clinical diag-nosis and the MoCA.The Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, Vol 52, No 5, May 2007 W331Brief CommunicationNo significant differences were found in the rate of cognitivechange over a 6-month period when the MoCA and theMMSE were compared.	:39
It may be that the MoCA is more sen-sitive to changes in types of dementia that particularly affectthe frontal lobe because of its greater emphasis on tasks offrontal executive functioning, compared with the MMSE, butthe present study is unable to answer this question.Although the results cannot be generalized to a larger popula-tion, it would seem that, by identifying early dementia or MCI,the MoCA is a useful additional screening for individuals in amemory clinic setting who score over 25 points on theMMSE.In subjects with MCI, the MoCA also helps to identify those atrisk of developing dementia at 6-month follow-up.ConclusionsWe believe that the MoCA promises to fill an unmet need for abrief screening tool that can help busy clinicians to identifyat-risk individuals who would otherwise be missed if theMMSE alone were used.Funding And SupportThis study received no support, and the authors confirm noconflicts of interest.AcknowledgementsWe thank the staff at Moorgreen Hospital, including Dr DavidWilkinson and Dr Jennifer Rowden.References1.	:40
