In thisstudy, the MoCA was applied to 8411 Chinese community dwellers aged 65 or older (6283 ¼ cognitively normal [CN], 1687 ¼MCI, and 441 ¼ dementia).	:2
The optimal cutoff pointswere 13/14 for illiterate individuals, 19/20 for individuals with 1 to 6 years of education, and 24/25 for individuals with 7 or moreyears of education.	:4
With the optimal cutoffs, the sensitivity of the MoCA was 83.8% for all cognitive impairments, 80.5% for MCIand 96.9% for dementia, and the specificity for identifying CN was 82.5%.	:5
These indicate that with optimal cutoffs, the MoCA isvalid to screen for cognitive impairment in elderly Chinese living in communities.KeywordsMontreal Cognitive Assessment, norms, screening, validity, mild-cognitive impairment, dementiaReceived March 23, 2011.	:6

However, commonly used instruments, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE),1 are insensitive to MCI.2-4The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), which was pub-lished in 2005, was specially developed for detection of MCIand early dementia.5 Its final English version is a one-page30-point screening test, with a cutoff of 25/26 and 1-pointcorrection for persons educated no more than 12 years.	:10
Itssensitivity is 83% to 96% for MCI, and its specificity is50% to 95% for cognitively normal participants in somedeveloped countries or areas.5-11However, the MoCA still has problems.	:11
Using adjusted cutoffs, validityof the MoCA was explored for detecting MCI and dementia.MethodsParticipantsThis study is a part of China Cognition and Aging Study (ChinaCoast) which is a longitudinal national study on the MCIand dementia based on hospital and community population.A multistage, stratified, cluster sampling design was adopted1 Department of Neurology, Xuan Wu Hospital of the Capital MedicalUniversity, Beijing, People’s Republic of China2 Department of Computer Science, University of Otago, Dunedin, NewZealandCorresponding Author:Jianping Jia, Department of Neurology, Xuan Wu Hospital of the CapitalMedical University, 45 Changchun Street, Beijing, 100053, ChinaEmail: jjp@ccmu.edu.cnLu et al185in the community population.	:15
This study included 2 samplesrecruited from urban and rural areas, respectively.	:16
First,since China is a vast country which has a significant disparityin geography, climate, diet, culture, and economy, we choose5 representative regional centers across china (Beijing,Zhengzhou, Guangzhou, Changchun, and Guiyang).	:17
Second, 7urban districts and 6 rural counties were randomly selected.Finally, within selected districts and counties, 30 urban com-munities and 45 rural villages were randomly sampled.	:19
The eli-gible samples for inclusion were (1) 65 years old and older, (2)the Han Chinese, (3) listed in the census of the community reg-istry office and living in the target community for at least 1 yearpreceding the survey date, and (4) free of comorbid conditionsthat could affect assessment.	:20
Our analysisincluded 8411 participants (81.9% of the total 10 276 commu-nity participants).	:22
They were divided into 3 categories accord-ing to cognitive level according to established criteria: 6283cognitively normal people (CN), 1687 patients with MCI, and441 with dementia.	:23
In current study, patients (n ¼ 441) withdementia were divided into 3 subtypes: patients with Alzhei-mer disease (AD; n ¼ 293), those with vascular dementia(VD; n ¼ 110), and those with other dementia (n ¼ 38).	:24
Amongthe 1865 participants excluded, 1562 were missing any datawhich could influence the evaluation; 303 were with mood dis-orders or psychiatric conditions severe enough to account forcognitive dysfunctions (eg, delirium, major depression, schizo-phrenia) because there have been unique screening measuresfor them and these patients are not our target participants.AssessmentDetailed data on sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle,medical history, current medications, and family history werecollected.	:25
There aresome cultural and linguistic modifications from the originalEnglish version,including (1) In the short-term memoryrecall task, 2 of the 5 words were replaced by more familiarwords to elderly Chinese.	:29
(2) In the verbal fluency task, phonemic let-ter fluency was replaced by animal category fluency test.	:31
(3)English letters were replaced by Chinese ordinal charactersin the trail-making test because many elderly Chinese cannotread English letters.	:34
(4) For the same reason, Arabic numerals13replaced English letters in the attention task.	:35
A battery of neu-ropsychological and functional evaluations were also per-formed, including the World Health Organization–Universityof California Los Angeles Auditory Verbal Learning test,12 theChinese version of Mini-Mental State Examination,the Clin-ical Dementia Rating (CDR),14 Hachinski ischemic score,15the Functional Activities Questionnaire,16 and the Centre forEpidemiological Studies Depression scale.17 Laboratory testsand neuroimaging examinations were done when applicable.The MoCA was administered to a subgroup of 35 participants(12 CN, 12 patients with MCI, and 11 with dementia), twice at1-month intervals to assess test–retest reliability.	:36
All diagnoses were determined by a team with at least3 experienced physicians specialized in cognitive disorders.Diagnoses were made mainly based on the CDR and FAQ andwere independently from the MoCA and MMSE.	:38
Other tests wereconsidered for further analysis and for the subtype diagnosis.Participants were considered as cognitively normal whenthey scored 0 on all the 6 domains assessed in CDR.	:39
Criteriafor MCI included all the following elements: memory or cog-nitive complaint and at least one domain of CDR scored0.5; global CDR score ¼ 0.5 or 0; essentially preserveddaily activities and social functions; no dementia.	:40
Bothamnestic and nonamnestic MCI participants were included.Dementia was diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statis-tical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition, DSM-IV)criteria.18 Alzheimer disease was diagnosed according to thecriteria for probable AD as defined by the National Instituteof Neurological Disorders and Stroke–Alzheimer’s Diseaseand Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA).19Vascular dementia was diagnosed according to the criteria forprobable VD as defined by the National Institute of Neurolo-gical Disorders and Stroke–Association Internationale pour laRecherche et l’ Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN).20 Participants with either MCI or dementia wereconsidered cognitively impaired.Data AnalysisTest–retest reliability of the MoCA was assessed using theintraclass correlation coefficient.	:41

Men scored better than women even aftercontrolling for age, years of education, and place of residencein individuals with 5 years of education or less (difference ofestimated mean ¼ 1.6, P < .01).	:68
However, the gender differ-ence in MoCA score was not clinically significant in partici-pants with more than 5 years of education (difference ofestimated mean ¼ 0.3, P ¼ .10).Normative Data of the MoCATable 2 shows normative data of the MoCA grouped by age,sex, education, and place of residence of the 6283 cognitivelynormal participants, exhibiting a low average and broad rangein both years of education and MoCA score.Optimal Cutoff Points and Validity of the MoCAUsing the recommended 1-point correction for individuals with12 years or less of education and a cutoff of 25/26, the MoCAcould detect 98.4% of cognitively impaired participants but witha specificity of only 52.2% for identifying CN.	:69
For individuals with no formal education, the mostappropriate MoCA cutoff was 13/14 (n ¼ 2279, sensitivity80.9% and specificity 83.2%); for individuals with 1 to 6 yearsof education, the most appropriate MoCA cutoff was 19/20 (n¼ 3085, sensitivity 83.8% and specificity 82.5%); and for indi-viduals with 7 or more years of education, it was 24/25 (n ¼3047, sensitivity 89.9% and specificity 81.5%).Applying the adjusted cutoff points, as shown in Table 3,the sensitivity of the MoCA was 83.8% for all cognitive188Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry and Neurology 24(4)impairments, 80.5% for MCI and 96.9% for dementia (96.6%for AD and 97.1% for VD), and the specificity for identifyingCN was 82.5%.	:72
The MoCA showed acceptable PLRs and goodNLRs for MCI and good PLRs and excellent NLRs fordementia.After controlling for the 4 significant influential factors ofyears of education, age, place of residence and sex, as shownin Table 1, both the mean MoCA scores (estimated mean +SE score, 23.2 + 0.2 for CN, 15.8 + 0.5 for MCI, and 8.8+ 1.1 for dementia) and the mean MMSE scores (estimatedmean + SE score, 25.9 + 0.2 for CN, 21.5 + 0.5 for MCI, and13.1 + 0.9 for dementia) of 3 groups differed significantlyfrom one another (P < .01).	:73
Comparing the MCI and CNgroups, the estimated mean difference in MoCA score (7.4)was larger than that in MMSE (4.4).	:74
Figure 1 presents that theAUC was much larger for the MoCA than MMSE in differen-tiating MCI from CN (0.899, 95% CI 0.891-0.907 vs 0.842,95% CI 0.831-0.852; P < .05).	:75
There was no significant AUCdifference between the MoCA and MMSE in differentiatingdementia from CN (0.986, 95% CI 0.982-0.990 vs 0.985,95% CI 0.981-0.989; P > .05).	:76
As for ageand gender, the results were conflicting.7,8,11 In present study,however, all 4 factors (education, age, urban or rural residence,and sex) showed significant and direct effect on the MoCAscore.	:81
Therefore, all these 4 factorsshould be taken into account when establishing normative datafor the MoCA.In addition, we want to stress that the average MoCA scoreof CN was much lower in this study (23.7) than in the originalstudy (above 28).5 This could be caused by the very low scoresA: MCI vs. CN1.00.75.50.25ytivitisneS0.000.00Source of the CurveReference LineMMSEMoCA .25.50.751.001 - SpecificityB: Dementia vs. CN1.00.75.50.25ytivitisneS0.000.00Source of the CurveReference LineMMSEMoCA .25.50.751.001 - SpecificityFigure 1.	:87
A, The AUC was larger for the MoCA than MMSE in differ-entiating MCI from CN (0.899, 95% CI 0.891-0.907 vs 0.842, 95% CI0.831-0.852; P < .01).	:89
B, There was no significant AUC differencebetween the MoCA and MMSE in differentiating dementia from CN(0.986, 95% CI 0.982-0.990 vs 0.985, 95% CI 0.981-0.989, P > .05).AUC indicates area under the curve; CN, cognitively normal people;MCI, mild cognitive impairment; MMSE, Mini-Mental State Examina-tion; MoCA, Montreal Cognitive Assessment.of elderly Chinese on several subtests.	:90
Reasons may includethat the trail making and cube copying test are unfamiliar toelderly Chinese, and the 2 sentences for repeating, which weretranslated from English with minor revision, are too unwieldyor complicated for Chinese syntax.	:91
Moreover, estimated meanyears of education was much less in CN of this study (6.7) thanmean years of education of the original study (13.3), whichcould also affect scores on MoCA and its subtests.Given the low average and broad range in both educationlevel and MoCA score, it is easy to understand why the recom-mended cutoff5 of 25/26 was not applicable to elderly Chinese(high sensitivity of 98.4% for cognitive impairment, but lowLu et al189specificity of 52.2% for identifying CN).	:92
We therefore devel-oped optimal MoCA cutoff points based on education level(13/14 for individuals with no formal education, 19/20 for indi-viduals with 1 to 6 years of education, and 24/25 for individualswith 7 or more years of education).	:93
In other studies, 22/23 wasused for the MoCA Korean version6 and 24/25 for the MoCA incommunity dwellers of the Southeastern United States.8 Theiradjusted cutoff points were also lower than the original.	:94
This wasbecause the distinction between MCI and dementia should bedetermined on the basis of functional impairment due to cogni-tive decline and not a certain MoCA score.With optimal cutoff points, the MoCA effectively detected83.8% of all cognitive impairments, 80.5% of MCI, and96.9% of dementia in the entire sample.	:99
Its sensitivity fordementia was as high as that previously reported (93%-100%),5-11 while its sensitivity for MCI was lower than that foramnestic MCI in most of the previous studies (89%-96%),5-9with a specificity of 82.5% for identifying CN, which was alsolower than others.	:100
This shortcoming might be ignored inas-much as we actually got positive results in most comparisons.Moreover, to minimize its effects, LR values were used toevaluate validity of the MoCA because they do not dependon disease prevalence and can be compared between differentpopulations or settings.21-23In summary, population-based MoCA norms consideringsignificant demographic factors were established for elderlyChinese.	:104
