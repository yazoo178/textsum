J. LarnerCognitive Function Clinic, Walton Centre for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Liverpool, UKABSTRACTBackground: This aim of this study was to assess the clinical utility of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment(MoCA) as a screening instrument for cognitive impairment in patients referred to a memory clinic, aloneand in combination with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).Methods: This was a pragmatic prospective study of consecutive referrals attending a memory clinic (n = 150)over an 18-month period.	:1
Patients were diagnosed using standard clinical diagnostic criteria for dementia(DSM-IV) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI; cognitive impairment prevalence = 43%) independent ofMoCA test scores.Results: MoCA proved acceptable to patients and was quick and easy to use.	:2
Using the cut-offs for MoCA andMMSE speciﬁed in the index paper (≥26/30), MoCA was more sensitive than MMSE (0.97 vs 0.65) but lessspeciﬁc (0.60 vs 0.89), with better diagnostic accuracy (area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve0.91 vs 0.83).	:3
Downward adjustment of the MoCA cut-off to ≥20/30 maximized test accuracy and improvedspeciﬁcity (0.95) for some loss of sensitivity (0.63).	:4
Combining MoCA with the MMSE – either in series orin parallel – did not improve diagnostic utility above that with either test alone.Conclusions: In a memory clinic population, MoCA proved sensitive for the diagnosis of cognitive impairment.Use of a cut-off lower than that speciﬁed in the index study may be required to improve overall test accuracyand speciﬁcity for some loss of sensitivity in populations with a high prior probability of cognitive impairment.Combining the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) with the MMSEdid not improve diagnostic utility.Key words: cognitive testing, memory clinics, MoCAIntroductionThe Montreal Cognitive Assessment(MoCA;Nasreddine et al., 2005) is a brief (10–15 minute)30-point cognitive screening instrument whichhas proved usefulin identifying patients withdementia and – unlike the Mini-Mental StateExamination (MMSE; Folstein et al., 1975) –patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).MoCA is easily accessed and available in multiplelanguages (www.mocatest.org).	:5
As well as its utilityin cognitive clinic populations (Nasreddine et al.,2005; Smith et al., 2007; Damian et al., 2011),MoCA has also been reported to identify cognitiveCorrespondence should be addressed to: A.J.	:6

J. Larnerappropriate to index studies may need to be revisedin the clinic setting (Larner, 2007; 2009; Hancockand Larner, 2011).Combining screening tests to try to improvediagnostic utility in the memory clinic has beenet al., 1997;attempted on occasion (FlickerHancock and Larner, 2009).	:15
(2005)advocated sequential use of the MMSE and MoCAin patients with cognitive complaints and functionalimpairment if MMSE score was normal (≥26/30).A study was therefore undertaken to examinethe screening utility of MoCA in an unselectedcognitive disorders clinic population.	:18
The studyaims were to ascertain whether MoCA was usefulin the diagnosis of dementia and MCI in a memoryclinic population, and whether its diagnostic utilityis improved by combining MoCA with the MMSE.MethodsConsecutive new patient referrals were recruitedprospectively (September 2009–March 2011) froma Cognitive Function Clinic based in a regionalneuroscience center.	:19
Standard clinical diagnosticcriteria (DSM-IV) were used for the diagnosisof dementia (American Psychiatric Association,(Petersen et al., 1999),2000) and for MCIas in previous studies (Hancock and Larner,2009; 2011).	:20
The MoCA result was not used inthe diagnostic judgment of dementia/MCI (i.e.cognitive impairment) vs. no cognitive impairmentin order(Giffordand Cummings, 1999).	:22
Dementia subtypes were notspeciﬁcally examined in this study.Standard summary measures of diagnostic utilitywere generated (sensitivity, speciﬁcity, positive andnegative predictive values (PPV, NPV), diagnosticodds ratio (DOR), likelihood ratios, ROC curve)with 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI).	:24
(2009).Correlations and the test of agreement (κ statistic;Cohen, 1960) were calculated between MoCAand MMSE.	:26
The STARD guidelines on reportingdiagnostic test accuracy were observed (Bossuytet al., 2003).Diagnostic utility measures were also derived forcombined use of MoCA and MMSE using thecut-points (≥26/30) deﬁned in the index study ofNasreddine et al.	:27
(2005).	:28
both tests required to be positive before adiagnosis of cognitive impairment made: the “And”rule) or in parallel (either test positive sufﬁcient fora diagnosis of cognitive impairment to be made:the “Or” rule) (Flicker et al., 1997; Hancock andLarner, 2009).As administration of MoCA and MMSE wasalready routine in this clinic, the study was anaudit of established practice, so institutional ethicalreview and speciﬁc consent procedures were notindicated.ResultsOne-hundred-and-ﬁfty patients were assessed (M :F ratio = 93 : 57, 62% male; age range 20–87 years,median 61 years).	:30
Of these, 36 (24%) were judgedto have dementia by DSM-IV criteria, 29 (19%)had MCI by Petersen criteria, and 85 (57%) hadno dementia.MoCA proved easy to use, being completedin all cases.	:31
MoCA scores ranged from 5/30 to30/30 (Figure 1a), whereas MMSE scores rangedfrom 11/30 to 30/30 (Figure 1b).	:32
There were weaknegative correlations between age and MoCA score(r = −0.38; t = 4.94, df = 148, p < 0.001) andbetween age and MMSE score (r = −0.26; t = 3.27,df = 146, p < 0.001).	:33
MoCA and MMSE scoreswere highly correlated (r = 0.85; t = 19.2, df = 146,p < 0.001) but the test of diagnostic agreement wasnot so marked (κ = 0.39, 95% CI 0.26-0.53; whereκ = 1 is perfect agreement between tests and κ = 0is agreement purely due to chance alone).In the cognitively impaired group the mean(+/−SD) MoCA score was 18.3 +/− 4.5, and in thenon-impaired group it was 25.2 +/− 3.2.	:34
The meanMoCA scores differed signiﬁcantly between the twogroups (t = 12.0, df = 148, p < 0.001).	:35

The mean MMSEscores differed signiﬁcantly between the two groups(t = 6.62, df = 148, p < 0.001).	:41
Mean MMSEscores in the dementia and MCI groups were22.2 +/− 3.9 and 25.3 +/− 3.1 respectively anddiffered signiﬁcantly between the two groups (t =2.02, df = 63, p < 0.05).At the speciﬁed MoCA and MMSE cut-offsof ≥26/30 used in the index paperthediagnosis of dementia and MCI(Nasreddineet al., 2005), MoCA was very sensitive (0.97) butwith only modest speciﬁcity (0.60) whereas MMSEwas very speciﬁc (0.89) but not very sensitive(0.65) (Table 1).	:42
In other words, MoCA identiﬁedalmost all the clinically diagnosed cases of dementiaand MCI (63/65) but with a large number offalse positives (34), whereas the MMSE missed asigniﬁcant proportion of the dementia and MCIcases (22 false negatives = 35% of cases) but withmany fewer false positives (9).	:43
Comparing just theMCI cases (n = 29) against cognitively unimpairedforcases, a key differential in the identiﬁcation of earlycognitive impairment, results were little different(sensitivity = 0.93; speciﬁcity = 0.60), accountedfor by two cases of MCI with MoCA score of26/30.	:44
Screening utility between dementia and MCIwas not calculated because of the relatively smallnumbers (36 vs 29) and because this differentialis perhaps less crucial than MCI vs. no cognitiveimpairment in terms of clinical relevance.The overall accuracy of MoCA was examinedat all cut-off values.	:45
The best sensitivity for adiagnosis of dementia or MCI was 1.00 at cut-offs≥27/30 (with speciﬁcity no better than 0.42); thebest speciﬁcity achieved was 1.00 at a cut-off of<16/30 (with sensitivity = 0.25).	:46
Optimal MoCAcutoff, deﬁned by the maximal test accuracy forthe differential diagnosis of dementia or MCI/notdementia (= 0.81) was ≥20/30.	:47
When comparedto the speciﬁed cut-off (Table 1) at this MoCAcut-off there was improved speciﬁcity (0.95) andPPV (0.91) but poorer sensitivity (0.63) and NPV(0.77).Areas under the ROC curves, measures ofdiagnostic accuracy, were 0.91 (95% CI = 0.86–0.95) for MoCA, and 0.83 (95% CI = 0.77–0.90)for MMSE (Figure 2; note that an AUC of 0.5,Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.	:48

Nevertheless, the studyconﬁrmed the high sensitivity of MoCA foridentifying cases of cognitive impairment (dementiaand MCI), as previously reported in diagnosticallyselected populations (Nasreddine et al., 2005; Smithet al., 2007).	:60
The values for sensitivity (0.97),speciﬁcity (0.60) and area under the ROC curve(0.91) were very similar to those observed in thelargest series reported to date (n = 135; 0.98, 0.52,0.90, respectively; Damian et al., 2011), despitethe differences in case mix and the prevalence ofcognitive impairment in the cohorts (43% vs. 28%).MoCA compared favorably with the diagnosticparameters of other cognitive screening instrumentsexamined in previous cohorts from this clinic,such as the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination(ACE; Larner, 2007) and the Addenbrooke’sCognitive Examination-Revised (ACE-R; Larner,2009), despite dementia prevalence being higherin these cohorts and utility for MCI diagnosisnot being examined.	:61
Certainly MoCA performedbetter than MMSE and its derivative Mini-MentalParkinson (MMP) for MCI diagnosis (Larner, inpress).As in previous pragmatic studies examiningcognitive screening instruments (Larner, 2007;2009; Hancock and Larner, 2011), a lower cut-off(≥20/30) than that suggested in the index paper(≥26/30; Nasreddine et al., 2005) was found togive greater overall test accuracy (0.81 vs 0.76)with improved test speciﬁcity (0.95 vs 0.60) forsome loss in sensitivity (0.63 vs 0.97).	:62
(2009) suggested 23/30might be superior, while Damian et al.	:64
(2011) foundthat a threshold score of 24 would have superiorpredictive value in a memory disorders clinic wherethe prior probability of cognitive impairment is high.This study endorses the latter ﬁnding, and may beexplained in part by the absence of normal controlsas used in the index study (Nasreddine et al., 2005).Combining screening tests may sometimesimprove overall diagnostic utility (e.g InformantQuestionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly(IQCODE) and MMSE, Flicker et al., 1997;IQCODE and ACE-R, IQCODE and MMSE,Hancock and Larner, 2009).	:65
