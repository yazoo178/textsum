\chapter*{\Large \center Abstract}

Medical data comes in large volumes, making it a challenge for systematic reviewers to process and find relevant information. Being able to apply automatic techniques to this field presents itself as a suitable application for natural language processing. This report focuses on cost efficiency for systematic reviews by looking at how we can reduce the amount of data that needs to be looked at to make a decision. Existing approaches are examined and evaluated using a broad range of datasets. We developed and laid the foundations for new approaches within the field. We first looked at percentage cut-off methods by examining the similarity between documents in a set of rankings. We also looked at sampling methods by observing the general distribution of a dataset, building a model, and then making a prediction for the remainder of the data.
