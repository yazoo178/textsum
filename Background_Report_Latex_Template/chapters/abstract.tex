Medical data comes in large volumes, making it a challenge for systematic reviewers to process and find relevant information. Being able to apply automatic techniques to this field presents itself as a suitable application for natural language processing. We will look at two areas of this field. Biomedical information retrieval by efficiently indexing and querying a large medical database, can we return an optimum set of documents. Stopping criteria, given an existing set of rankings, what is the most efficient way to look at these documents and determine a cut-off (stopping) point.
