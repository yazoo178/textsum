\chapter*{\Large \center Abstract}

Medical data comes in large volumes, making it a challenge for systematic reviewers to process and find relevant information. Being able to apply automatic techniques to this field presents itself as a suitable application for natural language processing. As part of this report two areas were examined as potential candidates for future work. We critically evaluated existing methods to finding stopping points in ranked document collections as well as proposing some new methods. As part of the CLEF 2018 task for technology assisted reviews we built an IR system that uses limited information for retrieving relevant documents for a systematic review.
