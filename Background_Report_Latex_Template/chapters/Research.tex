\chapter{Research Questions} \label{rq}

In this chapter we will present research questions for finding stopping points in systematic reviews.

\textbf{1 - Development of stopping methods that can be applied to a wider range of document rankings} \label{sm}

The target and knee methods discussed previously \ref{target} \ref{knee} are assumed to have weights that are sensitive to the ranking set. We want to apply these methods to our own ranking set using the same weight that was established for these methods. 

We then want to look at methods that could be applied to a range of different ranking sets and still perform with the same level of efficiency. 

\textbf{2 - Establishing unsupervised approaches to stopping} \label{sm}

As previous methods have a reliance on a weighting or some type of prior assumptions about the ranking collection they fall under supervised approaches to stopping.

Potentially we can use the ranking set itself to develop stopping method that use the information given to us from the ranking algorithm (e.g cosine similarity score). We can then descend down the rankings using the score to establish a stopping point.
