\section{Indexing and Querying Medline}

Medline is a large collection of medical literature and data from around the world. Typically each entity will contain a title and an abstract containing some information on the study. Whilest Medline as a whole is very easy to access \cite{medline}, the large size and complexity of the data makes it difficult to retrieve the relevant information.

Being able to create a reliant index of Medline would help with the effectiveness of the queries. As such existing medline indexes and IR systems have been created \cite{nlm}
