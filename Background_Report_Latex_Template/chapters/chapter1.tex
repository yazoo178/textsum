\chapter{Introduction}

Medical literature poses interesting challenges for Natural Language Processing (NLP) researchers. The sheer volume of medical data makes it difficult for humans to process efficiently. One key task is the creation of systematic reviews. Systematic reviews are transparent reviews that aim to pull together and critically analyse relevant literature to a topical question. The process of creating a systematic review is rigorous and time consuming with varying degrees of complexity in-between steps. This report will look at the existing work done so far on using NLP as part of the systematic review process as well as the novel work by myself.
