number="1",
pages="5",
abstract="The large and growing number of published studies, and their increasing rate of publication, makes the task of identifying relevant studies in an unbiased way for inclusion in systematic reviews both complex and time consuming. Text mining has been offered as a potential solution: through automating some of the screening process, reviewer time can be saved. The evidence base around the use of text mining for screening has not yet been pulled together systematically; this systematic review fills that research gap. Focusing mainly on non-technical issues, the review aims to increase awareness of the potential of these technologies and promote further collaborative research between the computer science and systematic review communities.",

journal="Scientific and Technical Information Processing",
year="2015",
month="Dec",
day="01",
volume="42",
number="6",
pages="463--469",
abstract="The well-known linear scalarization of criteria is considered from the point of the general model of multi-criterion choice, which includes a set of feasible alternatives and a vector criterion, as well as the preference relation of the decision maker. The focus of this paper is the correctness of the application of this method for solving multi-criterion problems. A class of problems is analyzed where the use of linear scalarization can be justified. Moreover, a combined approach is proposed for solving multi-criterion problems, which consists in prior reduction of the Pareto set based on information regarding the decision maker's preference relation with subsequent extremization of the linear combination of the initial criteria on the reduced set.",
